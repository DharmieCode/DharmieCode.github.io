Subsequently, various guidelines were put in place to curb the spread of this virus. The aim of this project was to forecast the number of Covid-19 cases in the US. The dataset was retrieved from the John Hopkins’ Covid-19 data repository. The data contained information from January 21st, 2020, to February 11th, 2022. The time series models that were selected to make the predictions are Holt’s Exponential Smoothing and Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. <p> Github link to the project <a href="https://github.com/DharmieCode/Forecasting-COVID-19-cases-in-the-US.git" target= "_blank"</i> LINK.</a></p>  <p><h3><b> Project 2- ML PROJECT USING BREAST CANCER DATA </b></h3></p> <p> Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. This project aims to predict breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant by pre-processing the data and training the model using Naïve Bayes, KNN, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. The dataset was retrieved from the UCI machine learning repository.<p> Github link to the project <a href="https://github.com/DharmieCode/ML-project-using-breast-cancer-data.git" target= "_blank"</i> LINK.</a> </p>  <p><h3><b> Project 3- SURVEY ANALYSIS </b></h3></p> <p> National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a cross-sectional survey created to monitor the health and nutrition of the US population. When I decided to utilize NHANES data for my dissertation, I searched online and found only a few resources on NHANES data analysis using R. This lack of resources prompted this project. The dataset used in this project was the NHANES 2015-2016 & 2017-2018 data. <p> This project encompasses data extraction from the CDC website, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization (ggplot2), and modeling. The aim of this project was to examine the effect of diabetes on myocardial infarction using NHANES data. <p> Github link to the project <a href="https://github.com/DharmieCode/Survey-data-analysis-NHANES-.git" target= "_blank"</i> LINK.</a></p>
