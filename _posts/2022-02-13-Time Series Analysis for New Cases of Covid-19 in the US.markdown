description: <div align="left"> <h3><b> Project 1: TIME SERIES ANALYSIS FOR NEW CASES OF COVID 19 IN THE US </b></h3> <p> The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11th, 2020. Subsequently, various guidelines were put in place to curb the spread of this virus. The aim of this project was to forecast the number of Covid-19 cases in the US. The dataset was retrieved from the John Hopkins’ Covid-19 data repository.<a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19" target= "_blank"</i> JHU Covid-19 repo.</a> The data contained information from January 21st, 2020, to February 11th, 2022. The time series models that were selected to make the predictions are Holt’s Exponential Smoothing and Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. <p> Github link to the project <a href="https://github.com/DharmieCode/Forecasting-COVID-19-cases-in-the-US.git" target= "_blank"</i> LINK.</a></p> <p><h3><b> Project 2: ML PROJECT USING BREAST CANCER DATA </b></h3></p> <p> Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. This project aims to predict breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant by pre-processing the data and training the model using Naïve Bayes, KNN, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. The dataset was retrieved from the UCI machine learning repository.<a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28diagnostic%29" target= "_blank"</i> breast cancer data.</a> <p> Github link to the project <a href="https://github.com/DharmieCode/ML-project-using-breast-cancer-data.git" target= "_blank"</i> LINK.</a>
