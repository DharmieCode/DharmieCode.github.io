description: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a cross-sectional survey created to monitor the health and nutrition of the US population. When I decided to utilize NHANES data for my dissertation, I searched online and found only a few resources on NHANES data analysis using R. This lack of resources prompted this project. The data set used in this project was the NHANES 2015-2016 & 2017-2018 data. <p>This project encompasses data extraction from the CDC website, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization (ggplot2), and modeling. The aim of this project was to examine the effect of diabetes on myocardial infarction using NHANES data. <p> Github link to the project <a href="https://github.com/DharmieCode/Survey-data-analysis-NHANES-.git" target= "_blank"</i> LINK.</a>
